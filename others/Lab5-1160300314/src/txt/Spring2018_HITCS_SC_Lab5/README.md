file1 to file4 are data files for Lab5, and they are big to help measure the I/O performance of your program.

file5 to file8 are relatively smaller, and you may use them to tune your program before real I/O performance testing.

There might be illegal contents in these files, so you could use your Lab4 program to detect them, and then fix them manually.
